## IT Helpdesk Support Dashboard Output
The Satisfaction Dashboard is built using responses from 120 customers and analyzes key satisfaction factors.
It offers actionable insights based on demographics, repeat behavior, purchase patterns, and loyalty trends.

### Customer Demographics:

1. Female customers (66) outnumber males (54), Female-to-male ratio is 0.82; indicating stronger engagement from women.

2. Customers aged 50–59 are the highest contributors, so they should be the focus of retention efforts.
3. Senior citizens (60–69) are the least active, showing limited interaction with support or shopping.
4. 46.67% of users contacted the Contract Support Team; 58.93% of them were female—females prefer guided assistance.
5. 40% are repeat customers with "Good" average satisfaction score (5.13); retention strategy is working. “Customer service” is the top satisfaction driver; this area must continue to be a core focus.
6. 57.5% of customers made the purchase successfully converts to sales.
7. Only 31% of users show high loyalty; loyalty-building initiatives need to be prioritized. Females aged 50–59 show the highest low loyalty rate - targeted loyalty programs required. Females aged 30–39 show highest loyalty—this group can be used for advocacy and referral campaigns.

#### Bottom Line: Support quality is driving purchases and satisfaction, especially among females—but loyalty is weak in key age groups. It is suggested to double down on service consistency and launch targeted loyalty campaigns by age and gender.



### Regional Insights:

- Phoenix has the most repeated customer overall, while Texas (TX) leads among states. Consider targeting Phoenix and TX for customer loyalty programs or retention initiatives, as their repeat behavior indicates engagement.

- Los Angeles and Chicago top the chart for highly loyal customer distribution by city; Texas (TX) ranks highest by state. These cities/states are key loyalty hubs—offering exclusive benefits or faster service in these areas could further strengthen customer ties.

- Chicago customers have the highest satisfaction (avg. 6.36, rated "Good"), making it the most satisfied city. Illinois (IL) leads as the state with the most satisfied users. Maintain the service quality in Chicago and Illinois while using their service models to replicate success in lower-performing regions.

#### Bottom Line: Texas (TX) stood out with exceptional overall performance. Phoenix, Chicago, Los Angeles, Texas, and Illinois are strategic focus areas for loyalty, retention, and satisfaction-driven initiatives.
